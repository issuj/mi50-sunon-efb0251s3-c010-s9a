AMD MI50 fan adapter for Sunon EFB0251S3-C010-S9A

## Quick note

Looks like this repo is getting some traffic, so here's a quick note. Version 1 was a marginally too tight at the fan end, I was able to fit the fan on 2/2 prints but one of the shrouds broke a bit as I pushed the fan in. Other than that, seemed to be fine.

I tried to fix the fan mount with version 2, but I don't have any of them printed yet, so YMMV. The goal is to have the fan fit tight enough so that it doesn't need glue and can be easily removed as needed.
